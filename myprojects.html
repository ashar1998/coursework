<h2>Upcoming Projects</h2>

<strong>
<h3>Plans And Dreams</h3>
</strong>
<ul>
<li><p>I don't think I will continue studying computer science at RGU for the next 4 years. When I started studying I realised I don't wanna spend my life working behind computer screen. I will pursue my dream and study acting.</p></li><br>
<li><p>So, this would be moving out from Aberdeen after one year to Edinburgh, then to London after also one year.</p></li><br>
<li><p>Don't panic when you see me on TV or while you are watching a movie in the cinema.</p></li>
